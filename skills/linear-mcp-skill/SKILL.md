# Linear MCP Skill

Use this skill to run Linear GraphQL API operations through `uxc`.

Reuse the `uxc` skill guidance for discovery, schema inspection, auth lifecycle, and error recovery.

## Prerequisites

- `uxc` is installed and available in `PATH`.
- Network access to `https://api.linear.app/graphql`.
- Linear API key or OAuth credentials available.

## Authentication

Linear supports two authentication methods:

### Option 1: Personal API Key (Recommended for development)

1. Get your API key from Linear: https://linear.app/settings/api
2. Set credentials:
   ```bash
   uxc auth credential set linear-mcp --auth-type bearer --secret-env LINEAR_API_KEY
   ```

### Option 2: OAuth 2.0 (For production/user-delegated access)

1. Create an OAuth app in Linear: https://linear.app/settings/api
2. Start OAuth login:
   ```bash
   uxc auth oauth login linear-mcp \
     --endpoint https://api.linear.app/graphql \
     --flow authorization_code \
     --redirect-uri http://127.0.0.1:8788/callback \
     --scope read \
     --scope write
   ```
3. Bind endpoint:
   ```bash
   uxc auth binding add \
     --id linear-mcp \
     --host api.linear.app \
     --path-prefix /graphql \
     --scheme https \
     --credential linear-mcp \
     --priority 100
   ```

## Core Workflow

1. Use fixed link command by default:
   - `command -v linear-mcp-cli`
   - If missing, create it: `uxc link linear-mcp-cli https://api.linear.app/graphql`
   - `linear-mcp-cli -h`

2. Discover operations:
   - `linear-mcp-cli -h`
   - Returns 471 GraphQL operations

3. Inspect specific operation:
   - `linear-mcp-cli query/issues -h`
   - `linear-mcp-cli mutation/issueCreate -h`

4. Execute queries:
   ```bash
   # Query issues
   linear-mcp-cli query/issues first=10

   # Query teams
   linear-mcp-cli query/teams first=10

   # Create issue (requires write scope)
   linear-mcp-cli mutation/issueCreate '{
     "issueCreateInput": {
       "teamId": "TEAM_ID",
       "title": "New Issue Title",
       "description": "Issue description"
     }
   }'
   ```

## Available Operations

### Queries
- `query/issues` - List and filter issues
- `query/issue` - Get single issue
- `query/teams` - List teams
- `query/team` - Get single team
- `query/projects` - List projects
- `query/workflowStates` - List workflow states

### Mutations
- `mutation/issueCreate` - Create new issue
- `mutation/issueUpdate` - Update issue
- `mutation/issueArchive` - Archive issue
- `mutation/commentCreate` - Add comment

## Usage Examples

### List recent issues
```bash
linear-mcp-cli query/issues first=20
```

### Get issue by ID
```bash
linear-mcp-cli query/issue id=ISSUE_ID
```

### List teams
```bash
linear-mcp-cli query/teams
```

### Create issue
```bash
linear-mcp-cli mutation/issueCreate '{"issueCreateInput":{"teamId":"YOUR_TEAM_ID","title":"Fix bug"}}'
```

## Guardrails

- Keep automation on JSON output envelope; do not use `--text`.
- Parse stable fields first: `ok`, `kind`, `data`, `error`.
- Use `linear-mcp-cli` as the default command path.
- `linear-mcp-cli <operation> ...` is equivalent to `uxc https://api.linear.app/graphql <operation> ...`.
- Prefer read operations first (query/*), then write operations (mutation/*).
- For write operations, always confirm user intent before execution.
- If auth fails, check credential with `uxc auth credential info linear-mcp`.
